    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If cauliflower rice feels overdone, here's the perfect solution: Parsnips! They're the same color as cauliflower 
        and offer a whole different host of nutrients and flavor profiles to satisfy your cravings.</p>

    <p>This Teriyaki Chicken Meatballs & Parsnip Rice is grain-free, AIP-friendly, sugar-free, soy-free, gluten-free and egg-free.</p>
    <p>Makes 4 servings. 35 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Extra Lean Ground Chicken</li>
        <li>2 Garlic (clove, minced, divided)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Ginger (fresh, minced, divided)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Coconut Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Sea Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Cilanro (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 Parsnip (peeled, chopped)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Avocado Oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Coconut Aminos</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Orange Juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp Arrowroot Powder or Cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Water</li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the ground chicken, half the garlic, half the ginger, coconut flour, sea salt and cilantro. Mix well until combined. Roll into balls, roughly the
            size of golf-balls, and place on the baking sheet. Cook for 22 to 25 minutes,
            until cooked through.</li>
        <li>While the meatballs cook, add the chopped parsnips to a blender or food
            processor and process until it resembles rice, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>In a skillet over medium-low heat add the avocado oil and the riced parsnip to
            the skillet. Cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
        <li>In a small pot over medium-low heat, add the coconut aminos, the remaining
             garlic, remaining ginger and orange juice. Whisk the ingredients and bring to a
            low simmer. Whisk in the arrowroot powder and water. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes,
            until thickened.</li>
        <li>Divide the parsnip rice between plates. Top with chicken meatballs and pour
            the teriyaki sauce over top. Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>

    rice.</p>
